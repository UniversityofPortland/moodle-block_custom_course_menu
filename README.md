## Installation

Simply rename the `moodle-block_custom_course_menu` to `custom_course_menu`, move the folder into your blocks directory, and
run the _Notifications_ admin link.

*NOTE: If you are replacing the old block_my_courses with this new version, make sure you run the transition_tool.php file BEFORE uninstalling the old my_courses block. This will migrate all of the my_courses block data to the new custom_course_menu block.*

## Instructions

1. Turn block editing mode on by clicking the **gear icon** in the bottom right corner.
2. Hide courses and cateogires by clicking the **eye icon** next to them. When a course or category has its eye shut and is ~~strikethrough~~ it is hidden.
3. Sort courses and categories by **dragging them** into the order you would like.
4. After you are finished customizing your course menu, click the **gear icon** once again to save your changes and turn editing mode off.
